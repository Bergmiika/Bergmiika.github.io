## 📖 About This Project

This portfolio website is itself a **learning project** - created as part of my MEng Innovation Expertise studies at Savonia University of Applied Sciences. The goal was to explore how AI tools like Claude can accelerate development while maintaining authenticity and quality.

**Key Stats:**
- ⏱️ **Time:** ~2 hours from concept to deployment
- 🤖 **AI Contribution:** ~90% of code generation
- 👨‍💻 **Human Contribution:** Strategy, content, context, refinement
- 📦 **Dependencies:** Zero (pure HTML/CSS/JS)

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Explore AI-assisted development** in a real-world context
2. **Document the process** for educational purposes (MEng Innovation Expertise)
3. **Create a functional portfolio** that demonstrates both technical and AI collaboration skills
4. **Share learnings** with the community

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic, accessible markup
- **CSS3** - Custom properties, Grid, Flexbox

## 🤖 AI-Human Collaboration Process

### What AI Did Well:
- ✅ **Structure & Layout** - Semantic HTML, responsive grid
- ✅ **Consistency** - Uniform styling, proper hierarchy
- ✅ **Speed** - Generated 800+ lines in minutes
- ✅ **Best Practices** - SEO, accessibility basics, mobile-first

### What Human Input Was Critical For:
- 🎯 **Content** - Personal story, achievements, values
- 🎯 **Context** - Understanding goals (not job hunting!)
- 🎯 **Authenticity** - Tone, voice, personality
- 🎯 **Strategy** - What to emphasize, what to omit
- 🎯 **Refinement** - Iterative improvements based on feedback

### The Sweet Spot:
**AI for structure + Human for soul = Authentic, professional result**

---

## 📚 Key Learnings

### Technical Learnings:
1. **Pure HTML/CSS/JS still viable** - No need for heavy frameworks for simple sites
2. **CSS Grid is powerful** - Modern layouts without Bootstrap
3. **SEO basics matter** - Meta tags made a big difference
4. **Mobile-first works** - Easier to scale up than scale down

### AI Collaboration Learnings:
1. **Clear instructions = better output** - Be specific about goals and constraints
2. **Iteration is key** - First version is rarely perfect
3. **AI excels at patterns** - Structure, consistency, best practices
4. **Human judgment essential** - Context, tone, strategic decisions
5. **Document as you go** - Easier to remember process real-time

### Process Learnings:
1. **Start with goals, not code** - What's the purpose? Who's the audience?
2. **Gather content first** - LinkedIn profile, CV, key achievements
3. **Iterate in small steps** - Don't try to perfect everything at once
4. **Get feedback early** - Test with real users (colleagues, friends)
5. **Ship it!** - Done is better than perfect
